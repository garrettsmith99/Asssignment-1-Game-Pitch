City Escaper 

-My game is called City Escaper its about a girl named Roxanne who has to shoot robots with her laser gun. Roxanne has to run around a big city and jump across sky

scrapers to escape the monsters and robots who are attacking the city. Roxanne must rise up and defend her city off. There is a time limit set in the game, you will 

have to kill a certain amount of robots off before the time runs out. The robots drop items when you kill you them with her laser gun. The robots drop life potios, magic 

bottles, money and power ups. Roxanne can pick these up and make herself stronger. The game will save so you dont lose all the stuff you pick up from battle. There will 

be three different power ups you can find to change the power of Roxanne. This game is a platoform where you just run around defeat enemies, try to collect powerups and 

upgrades to add to your arsenol. I want to market this game as rated E for everyone, so everybody can enjoy it. For gamers who like adventure and platform games with 

weapons in them. A game where you need to listen to objectives to find the secret answers to my game. Where every background character is important to the story. in a 

world where the enemies have taken over and there is no hope left in the city. Living on a prayer that one day the choosen one will rise up out of the darknness and 

stand up to the creatures of the night. Roxanne must find her way out the jungle to save her city.
